## 1. Official Volleyball Rules 2025–2028 (DOC-20250421-WA0030..pdf)&#x20;

**Overall Scope:**
This is the FIVB’s rulebook governing all competitions from January 1, 2025 through 2028. It covers everything from court dimensions and equipment to scoring, player conduct, and officiating procedures.

1. **Game Characteristics & Purpose (pp. 7–10)**

   * Defines volleyball as a net game where teams send the ball over a net to ground it on the opponent’s court.
   * Rally‐point scoring: each rally awards one point; winner of the rally serves next and rotates.&#x20;

2. **Facilities & Equipment (pp. 11–16)**

   * **Playing Area:** 18 m × 9 m court, surrounded by a free zone (min 3 m all around; FIVB/world events require 5 m from sidelines, 6.5 m from end lines). Free playing space above must be min 7 m high (12.5 m for world events).
   * **Lines:** All court lines are 5 cm wide, drawn inside the court’s dimensions. Centre line splits into two 9 × 9 m halves; attack lines are 3 m from centre lines.&#x20;
   * **Net & Posts:** Net height 2.43 m (men) or 2.24 m (women), 1 m wide, 9.50–10 m long. Antennae (1.80 m long) mark lateral limits. Posts sit 1 m outside sidelines.
   * **Balls:** Spherical, 65–67 cm circumference, 260–280 g weight, pressure 0.30–0.325 kg/cm². All match balls must be identical.&#x20;

3. **Participants (pp. 17–21)**

   * **Teams:** Up to 12 players plus coaches/medical staff (FIVB events can list 14). Must sign score sheet; only listed players may enter.
   * **Team Leaders:** Captain (designated on score sheet), coach, assistant coaches. Captain handles coin toss, speaks to referees during playing time, and signs the score sheet post‐match.&#x20;

4. **Playing Format (pp. 22–26)**

   * **Scoring:** Rally‐point system—25 points to win a set (must lead by 2), match best‐of‐5. If 5th set is played, it goes to 15 (win by 2).
   * **Structure:** Coin toss → warm‑up → starting lineups → rotations. Positional and rotational faults explained.&#x20;

5. **Playing Actions (pp. 27–35)**

   * **Ball States:** “in play” vs. “out of play.”
   * **Playing the Ball:** Each team has max 3 hits (plus any number of block contacts). Faults include double contact, lift, carrying.
   * **Net Play:** Rules on ball crossing/ touching net, reaching beyond nets, and net contact faults.
   * **Service:** First service of set, service order, execution, and faults. Serving faults include stepping on/over line, ball touches net and doesn’t go over.
   * **Attack Hit:** Characteristics (any part of hand/arm allowed), restrictions on back‑row attacking in front of attack line.
   * **Block:** Permitted by front‑row players only; block counts as a team hit only if the blocker contacts the ball twice consecutively.&#x20;

6. **Interruptions, Delays, Intervals (pp. 36–41)**

   * **Timeouts:** Each team has two 30‑second timeouts per set.
   * **Substitutions:** Up to 6 regular subs per set, plus libero replacements and exceptional subs (injury).
   * **Delays/Sanctions:** How delays are classified and penalized (e.g., delay in returning serve).
   * **Intervals:** One‑minute interval between sets; teams switch sides at halfway point of deciding set.

7. **Libero Player (pp. 42–45)**

   * **Designation & Equipment:** Libero must wear contrasting jersey; libero replacement zone defined.
   * **Restrictions:** Cannot serve (unless competition rules allow), cannot attack above net height, must rotate back to front if replacing.
   * **Replacement Procedures:** Unlimited libero replacements in front row, subject to specific rules.&#x20;

8. **Participants’ Conduct (pp. 46–48)**

   * **Sportsmanship & Fair Play:** All participants must behave respectfully.
   * **Misconduct & Sanctions:** Warnings, Yellow/Red cards for misconduct (verbal abuse, unsportsmanlike conduct, delays, etc.). Sanctions range from loss of rally to expulsion.
   * **Procedure:** How to apply and report misconduct.

9. **Referees & Signals (pp. 49–59)**

   * **Referee Team Composition:** 1st referee (chair), 2nd referee, challenge referee (if video challenge is used), reserve, scorer, assistant scorer, line judges.
   * **Responsibilities:** Each official’s duties (e.g., 1st referee has final authority, makes calls; 2nd referee monitors under‑net play).
   * **Official Signals:** Hand and flag signals for all common calls (e.g., fault, point, substitution, timeout).&#x20;

10. **Diagrams & Definitions (pp. 61–85)**

    * Court layouts (competition/control area, free zone, playing court).
    * Player positions, rotation diagrams, and net vertical plane cross sections.
    * All official hand/flag signals illustrated.
    * Glossary of terms (e.g., “attack hit,” “penetration,” “libero,” etc.).&#x20;

**Key Takeaway:** Memorize court dimensions, net height, scoring system, basic faults (serving, net, rotation, block/attack), libero restrictions, and the roles of each official.

## 4. Single and Double Block (SINGLE AND DOUBLE BLOCK.pdf)&#x20;

**Overall Scope:**
Detailing the fundamentals of blocking in volleyball—both single and double (two‑person) blocks—emphasizing technique, timing, and tactical considerations.

1. **Purpose & Importance (pp. 1–2)**

   * Block is first line of defence and critical for winning.
   * Functions: intercept attack for a kill or deflect upward/backward to keep ball in play; screens certain court areas.
   * Only front‑row players may block; blocks can be solo (single), double, or triple (rare).
   * Against well‑coordinated multiple attacks, response time is 0.14 s—blocks require excellent timing and anticipation.&#x20;

2. **Necessary Conditions (pp. 2–3)**

   * **Height & Hang Time:** Jump high and stay aloft longer.
   * **Timing:** Jump at the right instant relative to attacker’s approach and set.
   * **Technique for Width:** Spread fingers, stiff wrists to maximize blocking area.
   * **Penetration Over Net:** Hands should reach \~10 cm over the net.&#x20;

3. **Individual Blocker’s Technique (pp. 3–6)**

   * **Ready Position:**

     * One arm length from net, feet parallel and shoulder‑width, knees bent (\~50°–60°), forearms \~shoulder‑height, palms to net, back straight.
     * Eyes track setter and spiker.&#x20;
   * **Timing for Take‑off:**

     * Against quick (first‑tempo) attacks: jump with spiker if set is near net (try to “roof” ball).
     * Against higher sets: delay jump slightly so arms are on upward path to meet ball just before or at peak.&#x20;
   * **Take‑off & Jump:**

     * Select take‑off spot based on set location and attacker’s approach.
     * Bend knees \~90°–100°, press arms back, keep back straight.
     * Use arm swing (bent elbows) to increase vertical lift.
   * **Arms & Hand Position:**

     * On take‑off, shoot arms forward/up to penetrate net.
     * Keep arms straight and parallel; thumbs \~5–10 cm apart, fingers spread, palms slightly cupped, wrists stiff.
     * For a kill block: wrist slightly flexed; for soft block: wrist slightly hyperextended.&#x20;
   * **Penetration Over Net:** Hands should be \~10 cm over net (closer to ball → more court is “screened”).
   * **Body Position in Air:**

     * At apex, engage core and shoulders, head tucked between arms, legs straight (bending knees reduces reach), maintain eye contact on ball.
   * **Contact with Ball:**

     * Hands frozen in position; try to contact with palm; no wrist action unless ball is very slow.
   * **Eye Contact & Anticipation:**

     * In ready position, glare at assigned spiker’s eyes to read intentions.
     * Use peripheral vision to watch passer, then setter, then commit to blocker’s approach.&#x20;
   * **Landing:**

     * Land softly on toes, flex knees to absorb impact, use arms for balance.

4. **Double Block Considerations (pp. 7–9)**

   * Coordinates two blockers: both time jump to cover wide area.
   * Communication and pre‑match scouting help decide who covers which attacker.
   * Both blockers adopt similar ready positions, align hands to minimize gaps, and slide laterally together when necessary.

5. **Drills & Progressions (pp. 10–12)**

   * **Individual Drills:**

     * Jump timing drills (e.g., block “roof” against coach toss), block footwork (slide steps into block), partner blocking.
   * **Double Block Drills:**

     * Two‑person footwork patterns, block coverage rotations, reading attacker’s approach drills.

**Key Takeaway:** Learn the block’s biomechanical and tactical elements: ready stance, take‑off timing, hand penetration, body position, and eye‑tracking. For doubles, coordinate lateral movement and timing with partner.

     * Speed = distance/time; velocity = displacement/time.
   * **Acceleration:** Rate of change of velocity (m/s²).
   * **Center of Gravity (CG):**

     * Imaginary point where weight is balanced equally in all directions.&#x20;

3. **Kinetic Concepts (Slides 6–8)**

   * **Newton’s Laws:** Foundation for motion analysis (inertia, F = m a, action/reaction).
   * **Force:** A push/pull causing acceleration; unit = Newton (N).
   * **Momentum (p = m v):** Quantity of motion; force = Δmomentum/Δtime.
   * **Impulse (J = F × t = m v₂ – m v₁):** Change in momentum; important for impacts.
   * **Power (P = Work/time = F × v):** Rate of work; unit = watt (W).&#x20;

4. **Angular Kinetics (Slides 9–11)**

   * **Angular Distance & Displacement, Angular Speed & Velocity, Angular Acceleration:** Rotational analogues of linear terms.
   * **Moment of Inertia (I = Σ m r²):** Resistance to changes in angular motion.
   * **Angular Momentum (H = I ω):** Product of moment of inertia and angular velocity.
   * **Torque (τ):** Rotational effect of force about an axis (τ = r × F).&#x20;

5. **Analysis Methods (Slides 12–13)**

   * **Qualitative Analysis:** Observation without numbers (multiple camera angles, focus on movement patterns).
   * **Quantitative Analysis:** Collect numeric data (motion capture, force plates, EMG); measure kinematic/kinetic variables.

**Key Takeaway:** Grasp both linear and angular motion concepts—kinematics (displacement, velocity, acceleration) and kinetics (force, momentum, impulse, moment of inertia, torque)—and be able to explain how they apply when analyzing sports movements.

## 6. Straight Smash in Volleyball (STRAIGHT SMASH IN VOLLEYBALL.pdf)&#x20;

**Overall Scope:**
Describes the technique and teaching of a straight (power) smash, including phases of the spiking action and key coaching points.

1. **Introduction (pp. 1–2)**

   * A smash is the primary offensive weapon in volleyball; a straight smash (hit down the line or cross‑court) is powerful (ball can reach \~160 km/h, takes \~0.33 s to reach baseline).&#x20;

2. **Four Phases of the Smash (pp. 2–4)**

   1. **Approach:**

      * Generate horizontal velocity that converts to vertical.
      * Typical sequence: 2 run‑up steps + hop (for right‑handed, first step with right, second with left).
      * Steps are \~85–90% of max speed, smooth and rhythmical; CG lowers as steps progress.
      * Maintain eye contact on ball, keep ball in front of hitting shoulder.&#x20;
   2. **Hop:**

      * Long, low explosive jump (4–9 ft), depends on run‑up speed; CG lowers further.
      * Sequence: Right→Left for right‑handed, swinging hitting arm back like a pendulum.&#x20;
   3. **Take‑off/Jump:**

      * Ball should be \~one arm length away on approach.
      * Swing arm down/back/up; heel‑to‑toe push off; knees at \~110°–130° on take‑off.
      * Synchronize trunk, hip, knee, and ankle extension to maximize vertical lift.&#x20;
   4. **Body Position in Air & Contact:**

      * Non‑hitting arm up, hitting arm cocked back above shoulder.
      * Body arches back, trunk rotates to “cock the hammer.”
      * Transfer force trunk → shoulder → hitting arm; elbow moves up toward midline, snaps into extension at contact.
      * Lower body: hip flexion & knee extension to stabilize, ball hit with heel of palm followed by fingers.
      * Contact at ball’s upper‑middle at peak of jump; follow through by letting hand continue in direction of ball.&#x20;
   5. **Landing:**

      * Land softly on both feet, toes first, then flex knees to absorb; arms out for balance.

3. **Teaching Progression (pp. 4–6)**

   * **Imitation Phase:**

     * Begin with a “step + hop” without full jump.
   * **Dry Run:**

     * Practice approach/run‑up with footwork only (no ball).
   * **Full Technique Drills:**

     * Approach + hop + jump + contact on coach‐tossed balls.
     * Emphasize arm swing coordination, trunk rotation, and hitting timing.&#x20;
   * **Drills for Power & Precision:**

     * Hit against wall or target zones; focus on consistent contact height/angle.
     * Use blockers/defenders for realistic simulation.

**Key Takeaway:** Remember each phase—approach (2 steps + hop), take‑off, swing mechanics in air (cocking, trunk rotation, arm extension), contact (heel of palm + fingers), and landing—and the associated coaching cues (eye on ball, body arch, synchronization of limbs).

## 7. Types of Strength (6 wk) (Types of Strength (6 wk).pptx)&#x20;

**Overall Scope:**
Classifies different forms of strength, explains how they’re developed, and identifies factors influencing strength.

1. **Motor Abilities & Strength Definition (Slides 1–2)**

   * **Motor Abilities:** Speed, endurance, coordination, flexibility, balance, agility, reaction time, and strength. Strength defined as muscles’ ability to generate force against resistance (neuromuscular capability).&#x20;

2. **Types of Strength (Slides 3–6)**

   * **Maximum Strength (Max Force):** Greatest force a muscle (or group) can exert in one maximal effort (e.g., 1RM squat).
   * **Explosive (Power) Strength:** Ability to overcome resistance with high speed (strength + speed)—important for jumps, throws.
   * **Strength Endurance:** Ability to sustain repeated contractions or maintain a submaximal force over time (e.g., many push‑ups).&#x20;

3. **Factors Determining Strength (Slides 7–9)**

   * **Neural Factors:**

     * Motor unit recruitment (number of fibers activated).
     * Firing rate (how fast motor neurons fire).
     * Intermuscular coordination (how muscles work together).
   * **Muscular Factors:**

     * Muscle fiber type (fast vs. slow twitch).
     * Muscle cross‑sectional area (size).
     * Pennation angle (fiber alignment).
   * **Biomechanical Factors:**

     * Lever arm lengths (bone lengths, insertion points).
     * Joint angles & muscle length–tension relationships.&#x20;

4. **Training Methods (Slides 10–12)**

   * **Maximum Strength:** High load (≥85% 1RM), low reps (1–6), 3–5 sets, long rests (2–5 min).
   * **Explosive Strength:** Moderate load (30–60% 1RM), fast concentric speed, plyometrics, ballistic lifts (e.g., power cleans).
   * **Strength Endurance:** Low‑to‑moderate load (≤60% 1RM), high reps (12+), short rests (<1 min), circuit training.
   * **Periodization Considerations:** Plan phases to emphasize different strength qualities (e.g., hypertrophy → max strength → power → maintenance).&#x20;

5. **Testing & Evaluation (Slides 13–14)**

   * **Maximum Strength Tests:** 1RM tests for squat, bench press, etc.
   * **Explosive Strength Tests:** Vertical jump height, power clean max, medicine ball toss.
   * **Strength Endurance Tests:** Maximum reps at a given submax load (e.g., push‑ups to failure).

**Key Takeaway:** Be able to distinguish max strength, explosive strength (power), and strength endurance; know training parameters for each (load, reps, tempo, rest) and the physiological/biomechanical factors that influence strength.

## 8. Underarm (Dig) Pass (UNDER ARM PASS. Hamraj Singh.pdf)&#x20;

**Overall Scope:**
Covers the fundamentals of the underarm (dig) pass, which is essential for serve‑reception and defensive plays.

1. **Importance & Purpose (pp. 1–2)**

   * Dig (underarm) pass is first line of defense for low, fast balls (e.g., hard spikes).
   * Quality of first pass dictates success of offense.
   * Easy to learn but requires precise platform formation (“the less we do, more accurate the pass”).&#x20;

2. **Grip Options (p. 2)**

   * **Hand‑Overlap Grip:** Dominant hand fingers and non‑dominant fingers form an “X”; thumbs together, palms flat; platform created by forearms.
   * **Fist Grip:** Make two fists, press together.
   * **Interlocked Fingers Grip:** Fingers interlace (less common due to less stable platform).
   * Proper platform is key—palms create flat surface; slight pressure at heel of palms.

3. **Technique Phases (pp. 2–4)**

   * **Stance (Ready Position):**

     * Diagonal stance, one foot slightly ahead; feet \~shoulder‑width; weight on balls of feet, knees slightly bent (\~knees over toes), trunk forward; arms hanging at \~135° elbow. Eyes on incoming ball.&#x20;
   * **Preparation:**

     * Move to ball, face target, widen feet if necessary.
     * Form flat platform by extending arms under ball; slight wrist hyperextension to widen platform; avoid elbow hyperextension (lock).
     * Bend trunk forward, set angle of deflection. Eyes track ball.&#x20;
   * **Execution (Contact Phase):**

     * Just before contact: extend body upward/forward, shift weight onto front foot.
     * Contact ball above wrists with both forearms, arms straight (no bending), shoulders elevated to reduce distance between arms.
     * Control arm swing (never above shoulder level); contact near midline of body. If ball is out of centre, rotate shoulder/shift to meet ball. Eyes track ball through contact.&#x20;
   * **Follow‑Through:**

     * Drive arms upward/forward until fully extended; shift weight forward; step if needed; keep eyes on ball trajectory; then return to ready position.&#x20;

4. **Common Errors (pp. 4–5)**

   * Contacting with palms instead of forearms.
   * Overswing or “swimming” follow‑through.
   * Not facing target.
   * Contacting ball too low (in front of face).&#x20;

5. **Drills (p. 5)**

   * **Individual Drills:**

     * Continuous vertical dig passes (in circle, on wall), dig‑and‑push‑up combos (after each pass, do push‑up), dig‑after‑bounce drills.
   * **Partner/Group Drills:**

     * Dig‑and‑set sequences, progressive distances, dig‑to‑target.

**Key Takeaway:** Focus on platform formation (flat forearms), correct ready stance (diagonal, knees bent), weight transfer, and controlled arm extension. Practice common error corrections (keeping arms straight, hitting at midline).

## 9. Volley (Overhead) Pass (VOLLEY\_PASS Hamraj Singh.pdf)&#x20;

**Overall Scope:**
Covers the overhead (volley or set) pass technique, primarily used by setters to deliver high‑trajectory passes for attackers.

1. **Introduction & Merits (pp. 1–2)**

   * Overhead pass uses fingers to direct ball; provides accuracy/control, sets up offense, can place ball high for attackers.
   * Usable from standing, jumping, kneeling, or rolling positions.
   * Controls game tempo by varying pass height.&#x20;

2. **Phases of Technique (pp. 2–4)**

   1. **Pre‑Contact (Stance & Preparation):**

      * **Stance:** Diagonal or medium stance (feet shoulder‑width, knees slightly bent, trunk forward), weight on toes.
      * Elbows flexed close to body, hands form a triangle/“window” above forehead (\~5–6 inches).
      * Face the target, track ball into position.&#x20;
   2. **Contact Phase (Execution):**

      * Keep eyes on ball through the “triangle” formed by thumbs and index fingers.
      * Fingers shape like a cup; thumbs face each other \~2–3 inches apart.
      * At contact, extend elbows/arms upward, push ball with fingertips (not palms), legs extend slightly to assist upward force.
      * Maintain ball over forehead throughout motion.
      * Do not flick wrists; contact primarily with thumbs, index, and middle fingers; little finger/ ring finger give support.&#x20;
   3. **Post‑Contact (Follow‑Through):**

      * Push arms fully extended in pass direction, don’t “swan dive” wrists.
      * Body fully extended, weight on toes; if needed, take a small step forward.
      * Finish in ready position, eyes on next action.

3. **Main Teaching Cues (p. 4)**

   * Move under ball, keep hands above forehead, fingers loose/spread, contact with fingers only.
   * Push through arms/legs together until full extension.
   * Keep trunk stable, head still, eyes open.&#x20;

4. **Common Errors (p. 4)**

   * Contacting with palms.
   * Dropping head or closing eyes.
   * Elbows too wide/narrow.
   * Not facing target (angle misdirection).&#x20;

5. **Teaching Progression & Drills (pp. 5–6)**

   * **Introductory:** Explanation → demonstration → warm‑up.
   * **Main Part:**

     * Dummy practice (no ball, just hand/arm motion).
     * Part‑method (focus on hand shape, then footwork, then combine).
     * Whole‑method (complete pass with ball).
   * **Progression Drills:**

     * Static overhead throws, partner toss & set, gradually increasing difficulty (varying height/distance).
   * **Concluding:** Cool‑down, address doubts, reinforce correct cues (e.g., “push until arms locked”).&#x20;

**Key Takeaway:** Emphasize hand “triangle” above forehead, finger‑tip contact (no palm), synchronized leg‑arm push, and finishing in ready stance. Correct errors by checking elbow position and head/eye tracking.

### Final Exam Preparation Tips

* **Timing & Roles:** For volleyball skills (blocking, setting, passing, smashing), practice each phase (ready position, execution, follow‑through) and memorize key coaching cues.
* **Terminology:** Be clear on biomechanical terms (e.g., force, momentum, impulse, moment of inertia, torque) and psychological phases (long‑term, short‑term pre, competition, post).
* **Diagrams & Measurements:** Recall court dimensions (18 × 9 m), net heights, attack line distance (3 m from centre), libero restrictions, and player rotations.
* **Mnemonic Aids:** For psychological preparation, use “SMART” goals and “IDEA” phases (Imagery, De‑stress, Evaluation, Adjustment).
* **Practice Drills:** Visualize or physically rehearse techniques—underarm passes (flat forearms), overhead sets (finger‑tip “window”), straight smash run‑up and arm swing, blocking footwork and hand penetration.

Good luck on your test!
